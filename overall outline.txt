            a. Physically going to one of the digital drop points, activating the AR experience, interacting with the 3D object, and collecting a charm.
            b. Downloading and scanning a graphic that will serve as an AR trigger, interacting with the 3D object, and collecting a charm.
        - Both of these tasks will grant a different charm.
        - Click the "Start Mission" button will kick fans out to the AR domain.
